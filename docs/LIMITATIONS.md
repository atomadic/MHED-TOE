# Known Limitations and Simplifications

1. YukawaAxonModel Approximations

- Hamiltonian construction uses simplified Dicke model rather than full microtubule lattice
- Mass mapping from Yukawa couplings is phenomenological, not first-principles

2. Orch-OR Calculator Simplifications

- Gravitational self-energy uses simplified Penrose formula with empirical scaling factor 4.54e12
- This factor is tuned to reproduce the target tau_OR = 9.2 ms (EEG gamma = 36 Hz)

3. Holographic Phi Calculation

- Uses simplified Phi = S/log|A| rather than full IIT 4.0 formulation
- RT surfaces approximated on discrete lattice rather than continuum AdS

4. Causal Set Sprinkling

- U_causal definition (chains/nodes) is non-standard in causal set literature
- Comparison to toroidal bridge value 2.87 is empirical

5. Revelation Tensor

- Bridge strengths (0.009-0.046) are assigned values, not derived
- Tensor structure (5x5x3) is phenomenological organizational scheme
